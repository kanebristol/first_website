        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My journey to Code Nation's Develop Coding course began when learning HTML at school to create web pages (and also later, tweaking MySpace profile colours and scrolling text graphics!) 
            <br>
            Fast forward to my Marketing career, I realised coding has a place in email marketing and website builds, which re-stoked my interest.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I found while managing a WordPress website for the organisation I worked for, that my interest truly lay in websites and improving them, so began to experiment creating websites using Wix. I realised the limitations of drag and drop editors, wanting to really understand websites underneath the hood in order to find the quickest and most efficient ways to build these for future clients. I decided to take the Develop Coding course to expose myself to new programming languages and understand which avenue of Software Development I wanted to pursue, or whether to build this skillset into my existing Marketing/Creative practice.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've learnt valuable skills from the course and the tech industry, including better communication within teams and using project management methodology such as Kanban and tools such as Trello to keep a build on track.</p>
            <br>Throughout this site you will be able to view the websites I have built myself, websites I have maintained in digital marketing roles for organisations, and the website I have created as part of the Code Nation Develop Coding course. Thanks for reading!
