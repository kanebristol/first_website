                <p>"IT has dramatically changed the lives of the individuals and organisations. Online shopping, digital marketing, social networking, digital communication and cloud computing etc are the best examples of the change to our day to day. Now accurate business planning, effective marketing, global sales, systematic management, real time monitoring, instant customer support and long term business growth cannot be achieved at the optimum level without IT."[1]

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1 (1.2) - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
                <p>There are several modern project management methodologies which can be applied to a digital project, and the skills and tools that underpin them are interchangable. Some of the most popular include: Kanban (which we have utilised throughout the Develop Coding course), Agile, Scrum, Scrumban, Lean, eXtreme Programming, Waterfall, PRINCE2 and PMI's PMBOK amongst others.[1]
                <br><br>
                These methodologies encourage the following skills: collaboration, enabling a fast delivery of a project, organisation, streamlining and elminating waste, limiting work in progess and focusing attention on the task in hand, effective planning, and robust development.
                <br><br>    
                Some of the best tools for completing a digital project are the following: Google has proven to be the leader in collaborative Office tools, enabling cloud access of Google Documents, Slides, Spreadsheets and Drive storage.
                <br><br>
                Alongside these, the following programs are strong in their respective areas:

                <br>To-Do Lists: Asana</br>
                <br>Workflow: Trello, Jira</br>
                <br>Milestones/Gantt Charts: Aha!, LiquidPlanner</br>
                <br>Time Tracking: Paymo</br>
                <br>Collaboration: Basecamp, ActiveCollab</br>
                <br>File Sharing: WeTransfer/Dropbox</br>
                <br></lbr>Communication: Microsoft Teams/Zoom/Google Hangouts</br>[2]

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1 (1.3) - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h2>
                <p>      
                I began to plan my website by drawing an initial sketch on paper.
                <br>
                I wanted a website that will serve as a portfolio for my web development and include links to previous website projects as the foundation of the site, before rolling out into specifics around the Code Nation course including the outcomes/answers.
                <br>
                Within Activity(2) assignment pages, I drew out an initial sitemap of one Intro page for the above, including sections for Websites Built / Websites Maintained / Code Nation Course, with the Code Nation course section linking through to two stand alone pages for each Unit Outcome.
                <br>
                As of Monday 8th, I wanted the Unit Outcome questions to be styled like Trello cards, with a responsive roll-over to reveal the answer and references.
                <br>
                On Tuesday 9th I created a wireframe of all three pages on wireframe.cc as I began to flesh out my design.

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1 (1.4) - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
                <p>Some of the key reasons why digital projects fail stem down to colloboration and communication. Often, it can be difficult to find a client and a vendor who are speaking the same language about what is required, and what can be delivered, especially when factoring in time and money.<br><br>
                <p>"Beyond collaboration, there are a few specific risks worth looking out for when it comes to digital projects:

                    Ignoring business processes
                    Failing to secure complete executive buy-in
                    Investing in sizzle instead of solving business objectives or improving customer experiences
                    Poor project definition / expectation setting
                    Bad vendor selection"[1]

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1 (1.5) - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
                <p>The main thing to focus on in using IT systems and software is the requirements for the project and this depends whether you are completing a project for yourself or for a client.
                    <br><br>
                    If for a client, the right way to start is understanding the customers needs and that will inform how you select the software/technology.
                    <br><br>
                    Some considerations include:
                    <br><br>
                    <br>"1. Complexity Type of the Web Application
                    <br>2. Size of Project
                    <br>3. Security
                    <br>4. Time to Market
                    <br>5. Scalability
                    <br>6. Bug Testing
                    <br>7. Web App Development Cost
                    <br>8. Maintainability
                    <br>9. Developer Community & Documentation
                    <br>10. Licenses

                    Things to Avoid While Picking a Tech Stack:

                    <br>Copying Competitors
                    <br>Depending On Personal Choices
                    <br>Following Trends with No Research

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1 (1.6) - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
                <p>Trello has helped me plan by providing the structure of the 'To Do', 'Doing', 'Done' Kanban methodology, and enabling an easy visual workflow to keep myself on track.
                    <br><br>
                    Using the Wireframe.cc website enabled me to visualise how the website would look, and doing it in this way made it easier to understand how many div tags would be needed for each individual section/box.
                    <br><br>
                    git and GitHub can be an effective way of monitoring and building on your code, as it enables other developers access to your code and enables them to add their expertise and collaborate on projects more easily. It also offers a learning opportunity from the social network, as "members can follow each other, rate each other's work, receive updates for specific projects and communicate publicly or privately."[1]

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 1 (1.7) - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
                <p>
                    GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulations which came into force in 2018. As web developers, you become a controller of a person's online data when they browse the site via data collected automatically (as cookies), or manually (when inputting details on a data capture form.)
                <br><br>
                    "All contributors to a project, whether they are employees, contractors, or volunteers, will be expected to be competent in, at the very least:
                <br><br>  
                    The European data protection and privacy frameworks (GDPR and ePD);
                    Any additional local, regional, or national privacy laws;
                    Any industry- or sector-specific data requirements, such as those in the health and financial service industries; and
                    Any development frameworks and methodologies used as standard within the workplace."
