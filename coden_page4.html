                <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 (1.1) - Describing the content and layout for each page</h2><hr><br>
                <p>I decided to create as little pages as possible for my site, which I have done from a useability perspective and is what I understand as best practice if it were a live site in terms of user experience and SEO, as the more pages you have the more you have to navigate through and for search engines to crawl.

                    On the homepage I broke the site up into three sections to treat it like a portfolio site, the top third is dedicated to websites I have built and has screenshots of them and links to them. The section below follows the same process linking to companies websites that I have worked on, and the bottom section is for Code Nation coursework which is split into boxes linking through to each Unit Outcome.
                    
                    On each Unit Outcome page I wanted to create a Trello board style to provide the background for my answers, but this hasn't worked out so I've used the Flex Container method again to try and make it look as presentable as I could within the timeframe.</p>

                <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 (1.5) - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2><hr><br>
                <p>"Material sent over the internet or stored on web servers is generally protected in the same way as material in other media. It is a fallacy that once material is posted on the internet it somehow enters the public domain. Anyone placing copyright material on the internet, or distributing or downloading material that others have placed on the internet, must therefore ensure that they have the permission of the copyright owner unless the use of the material falls within an exception. A copyright notice on a website will often set out what you can and can't do with the material on that site.

                    It should be noted that copyright material may have been put on the internet in other countries without infringing copyright there, but could still be illegal to use without permission in the UK, particularly if the website is aimed at users based in the UK."[1]</p>

                <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 (1.6) - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2><hr><br>
                <p>      
                    "People with disabilities access and navigate the Web in different ways, depending on their individual needs and preferences. Sometimes people configure standard software and hardware according to their needs, and sometimes people use specialized software and hardware that help them perform certain tasks.

                    Some common approaches for interacting with the Web include:
                    
                    Assistive Technologies – software and hardware that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. These include screen readers that read aloud web pages for people who cannot read the text, screen magnifiers for people with some types of low vision, and voice recognition software and selection switches for people who cannot use a keyboard or mouse.
                    Adaptive Strategies – techniques that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the Web, such as increasing text size, reducing mouse speed, and turning on captions. Adaptive strategies include techniques with standard software, with mainstream web browsers, and with assistive technologies.
                    Accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities. Features that support accessibility are becoming increasingly available in standard computer hardware, mobile devices, operating systems, web browsers, and other tools. Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer provides information about customizing your computer to take advantage of such accessibility features and solutions.
                    
                    Sometimes hardware and software with specific accessibility features, including web browsers, media players, or assistive technologies, may not be available to an individual. For example, tools may not be affordable, not installed or not compatible with the computer, not available in some languages, or not available for other reasons. In other cases, people are unaware of accessibility solutions or how to configure and use them."[1]</p>

                <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1 (1.7) - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2><hr><br>
                <p>The most common image file types are JPG and PNG, with GIFs also used. PNG is preferred for images which have text overlays. All browers can display them, and designers will choose the best option for a specific need.

                    "Two extensions are standard for web pages: .html and .htm. There's no difference between them, and you can use either on most web servers.
                    
                    Scripts are files that activate dynamic actions on websites. There are many types, but you'll see the following most often.
                    
                    .JS (JAVASCRIPT)
                    You can load JavaScript files into the web page itself, or you can place JavaScript in an external file and call it from there. If you write your JavaScript into the web page, you won't see the .js extension, because it's part of the HTML file.
                    
                    .JAVA OR .CLASS
                    These two extensions are often associated with Java programs. Although you probably won't come across a .java or .class extension on a web page, these files are often used to generate Java applets for web pages.
                    
                    .PHP AND .PHP3
                    The .php extension is nearly as common as .html and .htm on web pages. This extension indicates a page written with PHP, an open-source, easy-to-learn language that facilitates scripting, macros, and includes on a website.
                    
                    .SHTM AND .SHTML
                    These denote files that use server-side includes—coding that lives in separate files that are called into the page. Essentially, this allows you to include one web page inside another and add macro-like actions to your websites.
                    
                    .ASP
                    This extension denotes an Active Server Page. ASP provides scripting, macros, and includes, along with database connectivity and more. It is most often found on Windows web servers.
                    
                    .CFM AND .CFML
                    These extensions are given to ColdFusion files. ColdFusion is a powerful server-side content management tool that brings macros, scripting, and more to your web pages."[1]</p>
