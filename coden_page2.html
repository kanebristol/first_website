                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (2.1) - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trellos</h2>
                <p>I've found Trello to be useful, but it is only as useful as the information you put in and you need to have a process on how you will go about using it to track tasks before you start, as sometimes I would create a card for a more individual task, but then other tasks I've tracked have been larger goals.

                    Visual Studio Code has been good to use, I would change my approach by learning as much of the keyboard shortcuts as possible to try to be as efficient as I can on my next project.</p>

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (2.2) - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
                <p>In the past, I followed along with a Udemy course on building websites, and the instructor used Brackets. At first, as we started learning Python on VS Code, I found the user interface a bit more tricky to get to grips with than Brackets which might be a bit more beginner friendly, but this may also just have been because I was using the terminal for the first time to run code.

                    Now we're into the website project however I have found VS Code to be effective, and a quick research into how the community feels about both programs shows the reasons for using VS Code over Brackets https://www.slant.co/versus/52/5982/~brackets_vs_visual-studio-code
                    
                    I found Trello beneficial, but I do feel it works better in a group project so you are able to keep track of what everyone is doing. I may have worked just as efficiently with a pen/paper to-do list and Google Documents for writing content.</p>

            <div class="box box1">
                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (2.3) - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
                <p>Overall I am happy with what I have learned in building this website, as it is the first website I have designed using HMTL and CSS. I'm glad to have picked up a better understanding of using div to create sections, and also a new trick of using CSS Flexbox for creating containers and boxes.

                    However I had initially planned to put all of my Unit Outcome answers onto styled Trello boards on my website - I spent several hours trying to work out how to do this with Flexbox and online research, but I had difficulty making creating individual columns across a page which had one background colour of the container, and then individual boxes within each column which were sized and coloured differently to form the Trello cards.
                    
                    If I had more time I would have persevered with finding a way of getting this to work, so as it stands my Unit Outcome pages are less visually interesting than I had hoped. For this reason I think my website could be improved but I am happy with what I have achieved in the time I had, and with my current level of coding knowledge.</p>

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (2.4) - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
                <p>If I had more time I would have persevered with trying to build the Trello style cards/columns for my Unit Outcome pages, and I would also make sure that the website is fully responsive for Computer/Laptop/Tablet/Mobile by using @media queries, though I hope to still have enough time to do this.

                    From here I also could have looked to understand how to build a contact form and added this so potential clients could get in touch, and build more pages around the legality elements of the site, explaining privacy policy, cookies, GDPR etc.
                    
                    I would also like to have included a blog so I would be able to continually update with my ongoing learnings study of coding and development!</p>

                <h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2 (2.5) - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
                <p>I feel my work on this website has matched the requirements. I demonstrated good planning by using Trello as the foundation for my work, keeping me on track and enabling me to focus on tasks in hand for efficiency and time management. I used Diagrams.cc to create a wireframe for my website which enabled me to better visualise how I would go about creating containers for sections and how the pages would be structured.

                    Utilising a navigation bar and links to different pages, this enabled me to mirror a typical website's structure so the user is able to navigate the content with ease.
                    
                    I planned the visual element of my site by using https://coolors.co/ to find a colour palette I was happy with, determining which colours would be used for which elements and sticking to this throughout the site. I also decided on my font early on, only using two font styles in order to keep the design minimal. I made sure I styled effectively within my CSS in order to keep these elements uniform across the site.
                    
                    In terms of file storage, I followed the instruction of keeping my files loose in one folder which is different advice to a Udemy course I followed, which put everything (Images, CSS, HTML, JS) into individual folders. Unsure whether this is a preference thing or considered best practice, but I prefered the one folder approach as it requires less work when linking files, and less to break should you move or delete a folder later on which may be linked to your work.</p>
